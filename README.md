This repo contains my learning projects in machine learning where I implemented core algorithms from scratch without relying on pre-built models. The goal was to build a deeper understanding of how these algorithms work in practice.

Projects
	•	Linear Regression (Advertising Data) – predicted product sales based on investments in TV, radio, and newspaper advertisements.
	•	Logistic Regression (Product Counterfeit Detection) – classified whether a product is counterfeit or authentic using a common Kaggle dataset.

These projects helped me strengthen my fundamentals by combining coding the algorithms manually, manipulating and assessing the data sets and applying them to real-world datasets.
